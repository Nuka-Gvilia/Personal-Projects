# Fake News Detection with RNNs           

## Project Intro/Objective
Use Natural Language Processing and Recurrent Neural Networks to determine whether a news text is fake or valid.

## Model Used
- LSTM

## Technologies 
- Python

## Dataset 
Dataset with more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainpooja/fake-news-detection?resource=download&select=True.csv)

The dataset consists of 44,898 news pieces that belong to either of the two 2 types:
- fake
- valid

## Methdology
Use NLP preprocessing and LSTM network to train a model on the text data.
