# StreamLit Web App for Mushroom Classification               

## Project Intro/Objective
Build a StreamLit web app that will provide a simple interactive tool for users to fit differenc classification models. These models classify mushrooms into 'edible' and 'poisonous' categories. The app offers users the ability to select from a list of classification models, change hyperparameters and view classification model metrics for each model.

The "streamlit_app_demo.mov" file provides a video demonstrating how the app works after running the Python code.

## Models Used
- Support Vectore Machines 
- Logistic Regression 
- Random Forest Classifier

## Technologies 
- Python 

## Dataset 
Dataset with more information can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)

The dataset consists of 8124 mushrooms that belong to either of the two 2 types:
- edible
- poisonous

## Methdology

Given user's selection, train a classification model, make predictions and output model metrics (specified by the user as well).
